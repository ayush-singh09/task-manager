# Task Manager
- Hello fellow developers, this my project of react. I made this using JavaScript Library `ReactJs`. 
- React is now having some more function added to it which are not very much useful for the learning period. So, I used **VIte + React** which provided me the core functionality of react.
- I used `Tailwind.css` to style my project which provided me an ease for the UI so that I can focus on the Functionality of the Application.
- I deployed the project on netlify, you can see the results here - [Task Manager](https://insane-taskmanager.netlify.app/)
